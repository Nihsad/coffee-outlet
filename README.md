# ☕coffee-outlet
This is a Full Stack Application.

## Description
This project, titled "Coffee Outlet", is an interactive web application designed for coffee enthusiasts. It operates on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a platform for users to share their experiences by posting about new coffee shops. Users can also provide feedback on coffee shops added by themselves or others, fostering a community of shared insights and experiences.

One of the unique features of Coffee Outlet is its point system. Users earn points for adding new coffee shops, encouraging active participation within the community.

The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize for robust back-end operations, Handlebars.js for seamless front-end interactions, and PostgreSQL for reliable data persistence. Deployed on Render, Coffee Outlet offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for coffee lovers to connect, share, and engage with each other.
